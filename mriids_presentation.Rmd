???
- The rapid growth of the internet has fostered a corresponding
  increase in tools for internet based disease detection and
  monitoring that lie at the other end of the spectrum.
- Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases was one of the first
  entrants in the field of digital disease surveillance.
- ProMED reported in March 2014 on the likely spread of Zika to
  Americas, well before February 2015.

  system, developed by WHO.

# ProMED, HealthMap, and WHO: Incidence
<br><br>
![](who-hm-promed-comparison-13-1.png)

???
- There were substantial differences between the incidence time series
  derived from the three data sources, particularly at the peak of the
  epidemic.
- Potential reasons - variability in digital surveillance reporting
- WHO data are a cleaned version, made available 1 year after the epidemic was over.
---

# Comparing R Estimates
<br><br>
![](who-hm-promed-comparison-14-1.png)

???
- the time-varying transmissibility, measured by the reproduction
  number (the average number of secondary cases at time t per infected
  individual), were better correlated.

# Movement between spatial units

Approximated by a phenomenological model (e.g. gravity<sup>1</sup> or
radiation model<sup>2</sup>), or informed by other sources such as air
or road traffic data.

$$\phi_{i \rightarrow j} = \frac{N_i N_j}{d_{i, j}^{\gamma}}.$$

$$p_{i \rightarrow j} = (1 - p_{stay}^i)\frac{\phi_{i \rightarrow j}}{\sum_{x}{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  x}}}$$

# Model Fitting & Forecasts
<br><br>
+ Model fitted to incidence data from all countries in Africa.

+ Model parameters - reproduction numbers for each country, distance
  exponent, and probability of staying - estimated using MCMC in R.
  
+ For forward simulations, transmissibility assumed to be constant
  over the forecast horizon.

+ Forecasts produce every 7th day, to simulate analysis carried out in 
an ongoing epidemic.

---
# Model Performance

+ Variable model performance in predicting the number of cases.

+ Better at short forecast horizons, becomes worse as forecasts are
made over longer horizons.

---

# Risk of Spatial Spread

+ For each week and each country in Africa, generated an alert if the
  predicted incidence (a predetermined percentile of the forecast
  interval) was greater than 0. 
  
+ True alert - if observed incidence is non-zero, false is alert was
  raised but no cases observed in that week, missed alert if there
  were cases but no alert was raised.

# Risk of Spatial Spread: ROC Curve
<br><br>
![:scale 200%](2019-11-29_roc_ProMED_14_28.png)


??? 
- our model achieved high sensitivity but variable specificity
- sensitivity of the model remained high over longer forecast horizon
  while the specificity deteriorated,
- more false alerts being raised 4 week ahead

# Conclusion
<br><br> 
+ Variable performance in predicting number of cases.

+ Scope for model improvement - different mobility models, increase
  model complexity, more data on human movement.
  
+ Model performed very well in predicting risk of spatial spread.

+ Correctly attributed high risk of importation to source country.

+ First demonstration of using data from two widely used digital 
  surveillance tools for epidemic forecasting.
